# Implementation Note (Feb 2026):
LLM/Multimodal Reasoning Integration is now active. The agent pipeline uses Groq/Gemini LLM via llm_reasoning.py as a fallback for ambiguous or complex ATC events. ReasoningEngine calls the LLM when rule-based and ML logic cannot decide, extracting actionable ATC instructions from LLM responses. This enables advanced decision support and robust automation for edge cases.


Problem Statement & Challenges

I am developing an autonomous ATC bot for Tower3D Pro that should:
- Observe live game panels (DBRITE, ADIRS, strips) and detect events such as aircraft landing, taxiing, arrivals, and departures.
- Automatically issue the correct ATC instructions based on the detected events, using both rule-based logic and advanced reasoning (Groq LLM/meta-llama).
- Evaluate the game state in real time, similar to live video analysis, without relying solely on static screenshots.

Current Issues & Challenges:
1. **Live Data Access:** The game does not provide a direct API or internal data feed, so the bot must use screen capture and OCR to interpret the game state. This is less efficient and can be error-prone compared to direct data access.
2. **Event Detection Accuracy:** Reliably detecting events from visual panels is challenging due to screen noise, resolution changes, and OCR errors. False positives/negatives can affect decision quality.
3. **Real-Time Performance:** Processing screenshots or video frames quickly enough for real-time decisions requires optimized code and sufficient hardware resources.
4. **Command Mapping:** Mapping detected events to the correct ATC instructions needs robust, adaptable logic. The rules may need frequent updates as the game or ATC procedures evolve.
5. **Advanced Reasoning Integration:** Integrating Groq LLM/meta-llama for decision support adds complexity, especially in extracting actionable commands from natural language responses.
6. **Training and Adaptation:** Collecting enough high-quality data for ML training and ensuring the bot adapts to new scenarios is an ongoing challenge. The bot must learn from user actions and improve over time.

Guidance Needed:
- Suggestions for improving live data access or integrating with the game more directly.
- Best practices for real-time event detection and OCR accuracy.
- Advice on optimizing performance for live evaluation.
- Strategies for robust command mapping and reasoning logic.
- Tips for effective LLM integration and extracting actionable decisions.
- Recommendations for building a scalable training pipeline and adapting to new ATC scenarios.

Things We Are Trying to Implement:
- Enhanced rule-based and ML logic for event detection and command mapping.
- Groq LLM/meta-llama integration for advanced reasoning and decision support.
- Structured logging and training data collection for continuous improvement.
- Real-time frame capture and processing for near-live evaluation.
